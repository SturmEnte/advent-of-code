# Advent of code

## About

My solutions for the challanges of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) calendar.
Please don't just run them for the solutions. I made these public, so you can see **one** way of getting the solution.
Other solutions and help can be found in [the official subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

## Languages

### C
Build and run command for C (while being in the folder of the year and day) with gcc:
``gcc part?.c ../../common/file_utils.c -o ../../solution.out && ../../solution.out input.txt``
