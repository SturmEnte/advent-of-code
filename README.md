# Advent of code

My solutions for the challanges of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) calendar.
Please don't just run them for the solutions. I made these public, so you can see **one** way of getting the solution.

# Programming Languages

- JavaScript - NodeJs (used in 2023/day 1)
- Python (used in all other solutions)

# Hint

For some solutions in 2023 is `colorama` required. Run the following command to install it:

```
pip install colorama
```
